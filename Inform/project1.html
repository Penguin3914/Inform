    <h3>Reeds</h3>
    Reeds are neccesary to play the Bassoon. They are separate from the instrument and located on the end of the bocal
    <br> A typical price range is from $25 to $50, depending on the maker and quality.
    <br> Sound is made when the reeds vibrate against each other and the sound waves travel through the instrument.
